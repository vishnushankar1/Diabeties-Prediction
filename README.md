# Diabetes Prediction

## Overview

The Diabetes Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on various health metrics. This project utilizes a dataset of patient information to train and evaluate a model capable of making accurate predictions.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `jupyter`

You can install these packages using pip. If you have `requirements.txt`, you can use:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
